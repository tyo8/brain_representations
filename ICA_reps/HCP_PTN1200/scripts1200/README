Set of Matlab and Shell scripts used to generate the HCP 1200-subject PTN release
Steve Smith, Oxford
April 2017

These scripts are intended more as "recipes" than bullet-proof
ready-to-run scripts. They will need editing to match your local
folder/file naming organisation; start by editing the two setup* files
and then carefully check each script as you run it. The DO* scripts
should be run in numerical order. Some scripts make use of a local
cluster and assume that SGE is setup, with calls via FSL scripts.

Additional things that need to be installed and included in the matlab path:

- CIFTIMatlabReaderWriter
